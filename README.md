# Knock-Knock-ClientServer

Hello,
Complie code as normal, run in two seperate windows.
Launch KnockKnockServer first, then Launch KnockKnockClient.
Using the Client window type "Tell me a Joke", Capitalization does not matter.
the server will respond and then wait for you to respond with "whos there". 
and so on and so forth....
